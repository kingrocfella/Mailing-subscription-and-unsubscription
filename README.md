# Mailing-subscription-and-unsubscription
A mailing system which stores the list of subscribed and unsubscribed clients, has an admin dashboard for checking client status and a copy button to copy all the emails of either the subscribed or unsubscribed clients.

The admin.php file is for the admin login page which grants access to the backend where a list of subscribed and unsubscribed clients are displayed.
The sub.php file is for subscribing clients to the database while the unsub.php is for unsubscribing a client from the database.
